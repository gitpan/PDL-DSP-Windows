  * export tags

  * Several other windows could be added.
     barcilon-tems
     ultra spherical windows

  * scalloping loss function is not working properly.

  * Other analysis functions could be added. There are, for
  instance, matlab scripts with these things implemented.

  * filter design tools. Most of these would belong in another
    module. But the tools to determine values of parameters
    for window functions probably belong here.

  * plot more than one window function simultaneously.
